# Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)

-------------

THIS IS BETA VERSION OF THE MOD
It's missing crucial things that can't be added before BG2:EE patch 1.4 and Siege of Dragonspear are released, so what hangs here is not representative to how the mod will work after it's officially released.

-------------

Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET) is a modification for Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition that merges whole saga into one game and provides continuity between the events of Baldur's Gate, Tales of the Sword Coast, Shadows of Amn, Throne of Bhaal and Siege of Dragonspear expansion (also for both Black Pits adventures). The name of this this modification probably rings a bell to those who have been following IE modding scene, thanks to the classic mod that inspired this project, called Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT), developed by Bardez and Ascension64. While EET remains mostly faithful to the premise of the BGT, it shouldn't be considered a direct continuation of that project. In fact both mods share little to no common code and took different design decisions in many aspects (more information in F.A.Q. section of the readme file).

Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy has two main goals:

I. Uniting of the Baldur's Gate series into a single, continuous world that doesn't feel like 4 separate campaigns
- Play all Infinity Engine Baldur's Gate saga games in Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition engine. One game, complete package
- Seamless experience, NPC continuity, better internal consistency between the games
- United journal system that keeps track of all 24 chapters of your journey, from the beginning in Candlekeep up until the end of Throne of Bhaal expansion (this feature will be added after patch 1.4 for BG2:EE)
- No restrictions in travelling between BG1, SoD, BG2 and ToB areas, once they are discovered. All areas accessible from the same worldmap

II. Becoming a mod friendly platform with additional modding possibilities that comes with fulfilling the first goal
- Solution for mods designed to affect BG1 and BG2 content at the same time (preserved variables, character adjustments, world state etc.)
- A way to create new content designed for higher level parties in areas that normally wouldn't exist in game (vanilla games) or would be blocked after certain points of the story (original BGT)
- Intuitive conventions for renamed BG:EE files and modders resources that can be used for adopting existing mods
- Limited support for mods installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE

-------------

note: obviously Siege of Dragonspear is not yet implemented. Any development related to it will be done on private repository due NDA restrictions.

Finished version of EET is planned to be released after the patch 1.4 becomes available for BG2:EE (probably close to SoD expansion release).

Feel free to test the current beta version. Keep in mind that it is not representative to how the mod will work on release. Things missing that will be added once new patch is released (code already implemented in private repo):
- Above mentioned united journal system,
- No restrictions for travelling to old areas.
