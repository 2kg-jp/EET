<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET) is a modification for Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition that merges whole saga into one game and provides continuity between the events of Baldur's Gate, Tales of the Sword Coast, Shadows of Amn, Throne of Bhaal and <a href="http://www.siegeofdragonspear.com/">Siege of Dragonspear</a> expansion (also for both Black Pits adventures). The name of this this modification probably rings a bell to those who have been following IE modding scene, thanks to the classic mod that inspired this project, called Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT), developed by Bardez and Ascension64. While EET remains mostly faithful to the premise of the BGT, it shouldn't be considered a direct continuation of that project. In fact both mods share little to no common code and took different design decisions in many aspects.</p>

<p>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy has two main goals:</p>

<p><strong>1. Uniting of the Baldur's Gate series into a single, continuous world that doesn't feel like 4 separate campaigns</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Play all Infinity Engine Baldur's Gate saga games in Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition engine. One game, complete package</li>
	<li>Seamless experience, NPC continuity, better internal consistency between the games</li>
	<li>United journal system that keeps track of all 24 chapters of your journey, from the beginning in Candlekeep up until the end of Throne of Bhaal expansion (this feature will be available after patch 1.4 for BG2:EE)</li>
	<li>No restrictions in travelling between BG1, SoD, BG2 and ToB areas, once they are discovered (currently going back to BG1 areas is delayed to Chapter 7+, after patch 1.4 for BG2:EE this restriction will no longer exist). All areas accessible from the same worldmap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Becoming a mod friendly platform with additional modding possibilities that comes with fulfilling the first goal</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Solution for mods designed to affect BG1 and BG2 content at the same time (preserved variables, character adjustments, world state, saves, things that can vary between installations like spell references assigned by WeiDU etc.)</li>
	<li>A way to create new content designed for higher level parties in areas that normally wouldn't exist in game (vanilla games) or would be blocked after certain points of the story (original BGT)</li>
	<li>Intuitive conventions for renamed BG:EE files and modders resources that can be used for adopting existing mods</li>
	<li>Limited support for mods installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BG2:EE</acronym> game.</p>

<p>EET offers two types of compatibility with mods:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mods installed on <acronym title="Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition">BG:EE</acronym> previous to installing EET on <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BG2:EE</acronym></li>
	<li>Mods installed after EET on <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition">BG2:EE</acronym></li>
</ul>
<p>Installing mods that are not compatible with EET can break your game or prevent installer from working. Please visit <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=27741">this forum topic</a> for an up to date list of compatible mods.</p>

</div>

<!-- ================== I n s t a l l a t i o n ================== --><a id="installation" name="installation"></a>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Core EET component (setup-EET) requires "clean" BG2:EE installation with latest patch (currently v1.3). Translations and voice-overs are of course allowed but installing other (especially larger) mods that changes DLG and BCS files, before EET, may cause problems with later patching, so it's better to keep the installation as clean as possible.</p>

<p>Final EET component (setup-EET_end) should be installed at the end, after any other mod.</p>

<p>The BG:EE installation (patch v1.3.2053 is required) should be either "clean" installation or with any combination of mods listed in <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=27741">this forum topic</a> (fist part of the post only).</p>

<p>Siege of Dragonspear expansion installed on BG:EE will be required after patch v1.4 for BG2:EE is released (currently EET is installable without it).</p>

<p>BG2:EE engine doesn't support BG:EE TIS files which results in quite inflated disk space requirement during installation (all BG:EE PVRZ TIS files need to be extracted and modified). Currently at least 6.71 GB free space is needed during installation. For virtual memory purposes, at least 500MB-1GB+ (depending on your operating system) more free disk space is recommended during installation. Once the installation is complete EET modification occupies at least 3.45 GB. If Beamdog will add support for BG:EE TIS files in BG2:EE engine above mentioned free disk space requirements will be much lower: at least 2.30 GB during installation, and only 1.70 GB total size of new data after installation. Mods installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE obviously increase free disk space requirements.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>It is recommended that you disable virus scanners, spyware scanners, and other background on-the-fly file scanners during the installation. These programs have been known in some cases to interfere with the WeiDU installation process.</p>

<p>Installation within Program Files or Program Files (x86) is not recommended due to the potential for O/S related issues (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control">UAC</a> trouble). Unless you are sure that you have full UAC permissions consider moving BG:EE and BG2:EE outside this directory.</p>

<p>EET is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> or <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a> and moved to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a EET folder and setup-EET.exe. To install, double-click setup-EET.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

<div class="code">
<p><strong>After the core component is installed your game folder should then contain additional setup-EET_end.exe file. It should be installed after all other mods (always keep it as the last component in your installation order).</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Please run setup-EET.exe in your game folder to reinstall or uninstall whole EET.</p>
<p>Once both EET components are installed and you decide to integrate more mods you can safely uninstall the last component by running setup-EET_end.exe and than install it again once you are satisfied with your mod selection.</p>

<p>If you are planning to use other mods than you should consider using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/BigWorldSetup/">Big World Setup</a> (support for EET will added to BWS soon) to download, extract and install EET and other mods. This approach will save you a lot of time and ensure that selected mods are compatible with EET and installed in the correct order.</p>

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

<p>EET is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive. Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a EET folder, setup-EET, and setup-EET.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-EET.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

<div class="code">
<p><strong>After the core component is installed your game folder should then contain additional setup-EET_end.command file. It should be installed after all other mods (always keep it as the last component in your installation order).</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Auto-installation (for expert users)</h3>

<p>Instead of directly starting the installation go to the command line, navigate to your installation directory, and execute setup-EET.exe using the construction below. Alternatively, place the construction in a batch file or the Run... dialog in the Start menu.</p>

<div class="code">
<p>setup-EET.exe --force-install 0 --skip-at-view --language <em>X</em> --args-list <em>[flags]</em> <em>[path]</em></p>
</div>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<div class="code">
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td><em>X</em></td>
		<td>
		<p>0 - English<br />
		1 - Polski (Polish)<br />
		2 - Deutsch (German)</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><em>[flags]</em></td>
		<td>
		<p>Any combination of below flags should be typed as one string (no whitespaces)</p>
		<p>0 or 1 - suppress prompt for choosing the WeiDU TLK language directory if different language than selected for EET installation is specified within weidu.conf file located in BG:EE directory. 0 - leave the weidu.conf as it is, 1 - update weidu.conf to use the same language as EET installation.</p>
		<p>m or M - suppress failed installation message that normally shows up if BG:EE installation contains mods not listed on EET BG:EE mods compatibility list (not recommended unless you really know what you are doing).</p>
		<p>d or D - keep EET installation files (at least 3.2GB) after the installation is complete (for debug purposes only, they are not necessary to uninstall/reinstall the mod)</p>
		<p>p or P - pre-define the full path to the Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition directory; if the path is invalid, setup will prompt for a valid path</p>
		<p>q or Q followed by number from 0 to 9 (without whitespace) - allows you to change TIS conversion quality from default 0 up to 9. Not necessary as direct comparisons in zoomed images didn't present any quality loss of the TIS file. Values higher than 0 may slow down the installation process significantly</p>
		<p>j or J followed by number from 0 to 16 (without whitespace) - another tile2ee tool setting. It allows to change default 0 value (auto-detect) up to 16. The number represents amount of "jobs" that this tool will perform at once during conversion (multi-tasking). It's recommended to keep the value at default - this way tool will automatically detect suggested amount of jobs depending on number of cores and threads of your CPU.</p>
		</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td><em>[path]</em></td>
		<td>
		<p>the full path, in quotes, to your Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition installation directory, used in conjunction with p or P in <em>[flags]</em></p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="code">
<p>setup-EET.exe --force-install 0 --skip-at-view --language 0 --args-list 1q0j0p "C:\Program Files (x86)\BeamDog\Games\00766"</p>
</div>

<p>This construction installs EET with the English language, automatically updates weidu.conf file located in BG:EE directory to use the same language as the one chosen for EET installation (if such unusual situation occurs), and pre-defines the Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition directory as C:\Program Files (x86)\BeamDog\Games\00766. q0 and j0 sets amount of jobs/quality of TIS to default values, so won't change anything (usage showcased here just as an example in case you want to increase them).</p>

<h3>How to start the game?</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Baldur's Gate</strong> - first icon in main menu (choosing this option allows you to play whole saga from start to finish - BG1, TotSC, SoD, BG2:SoA, BG2:ToB)</li>
	<li><strong>Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn</strong> - second icon in main menu</li>
	<li><strong>Black Pits II: Gladiators of Thay</strong> - third icon in main menu</li>
	<li><strong>Black Pits</strong> - start Black Pits II and choose new dialogue response during the first conversation in tavern: "You can tell a ballad with more subtleties and nuances if you have experienced something first hand. Listen to my story." (after finishing Black Pits portion you will again end up in Black Pits 2 tavern, so you can continue this adventure with the same party.)</li>
	<li><strong>Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal</strong> - start Baldur's Gate, equip a book (darker one) that has been added to your inventory and use it in game (your character will receive missing XP if it's below ToB starting point. Mages will automatically receive memorized spells appropriate to BG2 starting level, in the same way as if you would choose "pick for me" during character generation)</li>
	<li><strong>Tutorial</strong> - start Baldur's Gate, equip a book (brighter one) that has been added to your inventory and use it in game</li>

<h3>What are the differences between EET and the original Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition?</h3>
<p>Nothing significant, at least in the way you're going to experience it. Technically there are some minor adjustments to make the BG1 portion of the game compatible with BG2 resources but it's not something that you will notice in game. The only gameplay difference is the way the Iron Crisis items shattering is handled. Unlike vanilla game, in EET Iron Crisis affects not only normal steel weapons (0.5% chance for each attack in EET, compared to 1% in BG1) but armours (0.2% on hit), shields (0.2%) and helmets (0.1%) too. The effect is true for your party and enemies. It can be considered more a restoration rather than tweak, as from game files it's pretty clear that at least armours and shields were meant to break since they have corresponding flags set and unused icons are present too. If you don't like this feature then install <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET_Tweaks">EET Tweaks</a> components that will allow you to make it work exactly as in the vanilla game. Other than this obviously the game won't finish after the BG1 end movie. Whole game is also using a new Worldmap.</p>

<a id="What are the differences between EET and the original Siege of Dragonspear expansion?" name="What are the differences between EET and the original Siege of Dragonspear expansion?"></a>
<h3>What are the differences between EET and the original Siege of Dragonspear expansion?</h3>
<p>It's a little too early to write something for certain, as the compatibility for Siege of Dragonspear is not implemented yet. For now EET aims to include this expansion seamlessly which means you won't be restricted to travel to areas from the main game once you start the expansion. The history itself will be continuous so instead of starting from chapter 1, Siege of Dragonspear will take place over the chapters 8-14. SoD worldmap is going to be merged with EET Worldmap.</p>

<a id="What are the differences between EET and the original Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition?" name="What are the differences between EET and the original Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition?"></a>
<h3>What are the differences between EET and the original Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition?</h3>
<p>For the most part everything remains the same. There are however few new features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Full seamless transition between BG1 and BG2 portion of the game for join-able NPCs present in both games, regardless if you have them in party during transition (in vanilla game only CHARNAME could migrate to BG2 via character or save import functionality).</li>
	<li>Full transition between BG2 and ToB portion of the game for join-able NPCs (in vanilla game only those in your party were moved to ToB - other characters were spawned with new CRE files loosing all adjustments you've made to them at some point).</li>
	<li>A way to go back to BG1 areas in BG2: Shadows of Amn (currently delayed to chapter 7 or later but after patch 1.4 for BG2:EE it will be possible to travel back as soon as you leave the Irenicus Dungeon).</li>
	<li>A way to go back to BG1 and BG2 areas during Throne of Bhaal expansion (as soon as you leave Saradush).</li>
</ul>

<a id="What mods can be installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE?" name="What mods can be installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE?"></a>
<h3>What mods can be installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE?</h3>
<p>EET does the conversion of all BG:EE resources present in game "on the fly". That is why it provides limited support for mods installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE. The compatibility list is available in <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=27741">this forum topic</a>.

<a id="What mods can be installed after EET?" name="What mods can be installed after EET?"></a>
<h3>What mods can be installed after EET?</h3>
<p>A list of mods that already supports EET natively is available in <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=27741">this forum topic</a>. It's not recommended to install any BG2:EE mods that are not present on the list. We are trying to keep the list up to date, so please let us know in the linked topic if a mod with native support is not listed there yet.</p>

<a id="How to add EET compatibility for other mods?" name="How to add EET compatibility for other mods?"></a>
<h3>How to add EET compatibility for other mods?</h3>
<p>Adopting existing mods to conventions and technical features used by EET is relatively easy and intuitive thanks to modder's resources and tools included in EET package that can be used to drastically reduce time needed for such conversion. Brief explanation of the scope of needed changes is available in <a href="">this forum topic</a>, where we also provide support for modders converting their mods to support EET. Please refer to the <a href="docs/Developer's Documentation.html">EET developer's documentation</a> for detailed information regarding this task.</p>

<a id="What about compatibility with saves?" name="What about compatibility with saves?"></a>
<h3>What about compatibility with saves?</h3>
<p>Old save games from original BG:EE and BG2:EE are not directly supported - you need to start a new game. You can import a character or use "save import" feature though. As for the save compatibility with different installations of EET, before removing current installation you should consider coping old <strong>dialog.tlk</strong> (also dialogF.tlk in some languages) to appropriate <em>lang</em> subdirectory in your new installation folder. Usually this step is enough to make your saves fully functional, even if you change installation order.</p>

<a id="How does NPC continuity work in EET?" name="How does NPC continuity work in EET?"></a>
<h3>How does NPC continuity work in EET?</h3>
<p>Character migration to BG2 currently starts right after killing Sarevok, but in future transition will start after finishing SoD expansion. Some characters are not continuous (those without BG2 content) and are disabled immediately, whereas others appear in Shadows of Amn and so continuity is required. Continuity only occurs when a joinable NPC was in your party at any point during BG1 (even if you didn't had that character in your end-game party he/she is still valid for transition) and is not dead. After character is moved to appropriate area some adjustments are being made if applicable (attribute changes, alignment, portrait, soundset, item, XP, dialogue and script updates). Otherwise, the appropriate level of the Shadows of Amn-resident joinable NPC is created or character doesn't show up at all if NPC has been killed during BG1 (except Imoen and Edwin due to plot requirements).</p>

<p>Like in vanilla game at the end of BG2 your party migrates to ToB. What has been changed is Fate Spirit old party member summoning mechanics. It no longer spawns new versions of creatures but moves characters from BG2 areas to Pocket Plane. Fate Spirit summoning NPC list is created dynamically depending on who you met during your BG1 and BG2 travels. For continuity sake NPCs that you don't know won't even show up on the list. During Fate Spirit dialogue you can receive one of 3 responses to your request:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em><strong>I cannot do as you ask, child of Bhaal. The one you seek is dead and thus forever beyond my reach. This thread no longer connects with yours.</strong></em> - originally used only for Yoshimo, now valid for every NPC that has been killed and left in that state.</li>
	<li><em><strong>I cannot do as you ask, child of Bhaal. The thread of the one you speak is beyond my sight, as it no longer touches yours.</strong></em> - this unused line in vanilla game has been restored to cover BG1 NPCs that don't have content created in BG2. If you had a character in party at any time during BG1 (true for all NPCs, not only those with BG2 content) but that NPC didn't join you at least once during BG2 than he/she will show up on the summoning list, but you won't be able to summon such character.</li>
	<li><em><strong>As you wish.</strong></em> - NPC will be summoned. Spawned NPC is the exact same creature that you left in BG2 (items and other adjustments are preserved, dialogue and script updates are made, if applicable, XP is increased to default starting ToB XP if NPC has less experience).</li>
</ul>

<a id="What's the point in lifting restriction for travelling back to old areas?" name="What's the point in lifting restriction for travelling back to old areas?"></a>
<h3>What's the point in lifting restriction for travelling back to old areas?</h3>
<p>Maybe it's just me, but I've never accepted BGT as a true seamless experience because the game still felt to me like 3 completely separate campaigns with BG1->BG2 transition added on top of it. As you can read in the beginning of the readme, the main goal of EET is not simple merging of the games, but actually make it feel like a one, continuous journey. In order to achieve it EET lifts travelling to old areas limitations, provides continuous journal, uses the same worldmap during whole game, and offers seamless transitions between story arcs. The second goal of EET is becoming a mod friendly platform with additional modding possibilities that comes with fulfilling the first goal. Currently there is nothing interesting in old areas but we hope that modders will be interested in creating new adventures and surprises designed for higher level parties during BG2 and/or ToB portion of the game. Also thanks to the enhancements made to EE engine it's now possible to create <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=27181">custom spawns</a> for high level parties without tons of code or conflicts, which may prove useful for hypothetical mods that could try to make old places interesting for returning parties. In other words it can be treated as a playground for modders to add new stuff to the game.</p>

<a id="Why EET aims to open access to BG1 areas so early in BG2? It can unbalance the game!" name="Why EET aims to open access to BG1 areas so early in BG2? It can unbalance the game!"></a>
<h3>Why EET aims to open access to BG1 areas so early in BG2? It can unbalance the game!</h3>
<p>Once the patch 1.4 for BG2:EE hits, EET will by default remove the current delay for visiting old areas (due to technical matters it is currently delayed to chapter 7+). Free access to old areas indeed can unbalance early BG2 game, as it will be easier to get good items that the party could store somewhere during BG1 portion of the game, which creates another way to exploit the game for players that cannot refrain themselves from taking advantage of it. For this reason, once the functionality is fully implemented you will be able to install new <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET_Tweaks">EET Tweaks</a> component that can block access to them entirely or delay it for the chapter of your choice. The reason why such tweak is an opt-out option (you need to install separate component to get rid of it) instead of opt-in option is mostly related to the above mentioned second goal of the EET. Optional open travelling by default would drastically reduce amount of people playing with it (that's always the case for optional stuff) which is an equivalent of smaller player base for mods that aims to add new content to BG1 areas in BG2 portion of the game. So the end result would be smaller chance that anyone would be even interested in creating such content. Personally we would love to see stuff like for example an option to ask Grand Dukes of the Baldur's Gate city for help with gaining money to fee Imoen and other stuff that makes sense lore wise. If someone will take advantage of these new possibilities remains to be seen. Leaving the base game without such limitations will hopefully positively contribute to achieve this goal.</p>

<a id="Can I play EET in cooperative multiplayer?" name="Can I play EET in cooperative multiplayer?"></a>
<h3>Can I play EET in cooperative multiplayer?</h3>
<p>Yes. EET supports up to 6 people in cooperative, cross-platform multiplayer from start to finish. Let us know if you notice any problems.</p>

<h3>Fatal Installation Errors</h3>

<p><strong>"(...) BG:EE mod is not recognized by EET, so it can't be installed on BG2:EE"</strong></p>

<p>Due to reasons specified in <a href="#What mods can be installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE?">FAQ</a>, EET limits "on the fly" BG:EE resources conversion to vanilla BG:EE installation and mods listed in the compatibility list.

<p>The most likely scenario is that your installation is broken. Try reinstalling Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. Also you can try parsing the BG:EE directory using command line as described in the <a href="#installation">installation section</a>.</p>

<p><strong>WeiDU stopped the installation because of error.</strong></p>

<p>You may not have a clean installation of Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition or some resources are corrupted</p>

<ul>
	<li>When the installation prompts for install again, quit the installation</li>
	<li>Try reinstalling Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and/or Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition</li>
	<li>If you have other modifications installed, try uninstalling those and then install EET</li>
	<li>If you still experience problems, post the SETUP-EET.DEBUG file, located in your Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition installation directory, in the <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=195">mod forum</a></li>
</ul>
 
<h3>Minor Installation Errors</h3>

<p><strong>The mod finished installing successfully, but the message is "Installed with Warnings".</strong></p>

<p>There are several additional precautions added into EET installation code to inform the player if something went wrong. Open up SETUP-EET.DEBUG located in your Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition installation directory and search (ctrl+F) for the word "warning". If you can't figure out how to fix the problem post this debug file in the <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=195">mod forum</a>. Playing with installation that showed warnings is not recommended.</p>

<h3>In-game problems</h3>

<p><strong>The game has noticeable lag in Candlekeep and other open areas.</strong></p>

<p>If your computer meet or exceed the system requirements for BG2:EE than this problem may be related to uncompressed TIS files currently used by EET. It has been reported that some integrated Intel graphic cards (HD3000 for example) need quite recent GPU drivers to work correctly with uncompressed TIS files. The problem will fix itself right after you install latest drivers.</p>

<p><strong>Corners in interior areas are not displayed correctly.</strong></p>

<p>This is a known BG2:EE engine bug that will be fixed by Beamdog in next patch (1.4).</p>
