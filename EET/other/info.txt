other than "EET/cpmvars/eet_cpmvars.tpa" stuff from this directory are not used during installation.
It contains things that may be useful for modders interested in creating mods compatible with EET:
- "cpmvars" - common variables that can be used to make the mod compatible with BG:EE, Tutu, BGT and EET at the same time
- "mod checker" - analize files located in BG:EE override folder to find out if a mod that changed them can possibly conflict when installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE
- "--traify-tlk" - as the name suggest
- "auto_install" - an exaple how to automatically install the mod without being bothered with prompts (more information in the readme file)
