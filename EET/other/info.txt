Only "EET/cpmvars/eet_cpmvars.tpa" is used during EET installation. Other stuff from this directory are resources that may be useful for modders interested in creating mods compatible with EET:
- BGEE_to_EET_mod_checker - analyze files located in BG:EE override folder to find out if a mod that changed them can possibly conflict when installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE
- cpmvars - common variables that can be used to make the mod compatible with BG:EE, Tutu, BGT and EET at the same time
- EET_modConverter - tool for modders that would like to make thier mods compatible with EET. It contains several conversion options:
  1. PCU_custom - custom version of Ascension64' Platform Conversion Utility that has been expanded and specialized for BG:EE and BGT mods conversions to EET. Readme and some improvements for converting into cpmvars (automatically adding %eet_var%, %eet_script0%, %eet_scriptt% variables is not implemented yet) will be added soon.
  2. GAME_IS_patcher - automatically patches all GAME_IS commands appending ~eet~ to already present platform of choice parameter. 100% safe only for mods released for BG2:EE that don't have code related to BG1/BG:EE.
  3. Chapter_patcher - automatically patches all BG2/BG2:EE mod files to use EET BG2 chapter numbers. Currently useless due to this problem: http://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/42425/remove-hardcoded-limit-for-10-chapters-journal
- --traify-tlk - batch file that can be used to traify game TLK files
- auto_install - example file that shows how to automatically install the mod without being bothered with prompts (more information in the readme file)
