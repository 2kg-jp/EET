Only "EET/cpmvars/eet_cpmvars.tpa" is used during EET installation. Other stuff from this directory are resources that may be useful for modders interested in creating mods compatible with EET:
- cpmvars - common variables that can be used to make the mod compatible with BG:EE, Tutu, BGT and EET at the same time
- mapicons - bpbgtmap.bam file that can be placed in override directory while working with DLTCP worldmap editing that doesn't support PVRZ files. Don't forget to backup original file
- mod checker - analize files located in BG:EE override folder to find out if a mod that changed them can possibly conflict when installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE
- PCU_custom - custom version of Ascension64' Platform Conversion Utility that has been expanded and specialized for BG:EE and BGT mods conversions to EET. Readme and some improvements for converting into cpmvars (automatically adding %eet_var%, %eet_script0%, %eet_scriptt% variables is not implemented yet) will be added soon.
- --traify-tlk - batch file that can be used to traify game TLK files
- auto_install - example file that shows how to automatically install the mod without being bothered with prompts (more information in the readme file)
