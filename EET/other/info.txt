Only "EET/cpmvars/eet_cpmvars.tpa" is used during EET installation. Other stuff from this directory are resources that may be useful for modders interested in creating mods compatible with EET:
- BGEE_to_EET_mod_checker - analyze files located in BG:EE override folder to find out if a mod that changed them can possibly conflict when installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE
- cpmvars - common variables that can be used to make the mod compatible with BG:EE, Tutu, BGT and EET at the same time
- EET_functions.tph - this file contains functions and macros that can be used directly in mods to make them compatible with EET on the fly. Current functions:
  1. EET_JOURNAL - can be used to automatically patch all BG2/SoD mod files to use EET continuous journal system.
  2. EET_NPC_TRANSITION - can be used to automatically add NPC transition from BG1 to BG2 areas or disable NPC without BG2 content. Also patches FATESP.DLG and adds NPC transition to ToB.
- EET_modConverter - tool for modders that would like to make their mods compatible with EET. It contains several conversion options:
  1. PCU_custom - custom version of Ascension64' Platform Conversion Utility that has been expanded and specialized for BG:EE and BGT mods conversions to EET. Readme and some improvements for converting into cpmvars (automatically adding %eet_var%, %eet_script0%, %eet_scriptt% variables is not implemented yet) will be added soon.
  2. GAME_IS_patcher - automatically patches all GAME_IS commands appending ~eet~ to already present platform of choice parameter. 100% safe only for mods released for BG2:EE that don't have code related to BG1/BG:EE.
  3. Chapter_patcher - automatically patches all BG2/BG2:EE mod files to use EET BG2 chapter numbers. Currently not used in open repository
- --traify-tlk - batch file that can be used to traify game TLK files
- auto_install - example file that shows how to automatically install the mod without being bothered with prompts (more information in the readme file)

More information about new tools and code examples can be found in EET/docs/Developerâ€™s Documentation.htm file.
