This mod can be used to test if the mod installed on BG:EE is compatible with EET installation on BG2:EE. It generates a list of possible mod conflicts with BG:EE/BG2:EE resources that should be resolved during EET installation.

A list of already compatible BG:EE mods can be found in 'EET/compatibility.list' file that can be opened in text editor. Mods listed there can be installed on BG:EE before installing EET on BG2:EE - they will be converted with vanilla BG:EE files to work on BG2:EE engine as part of EET games merging procedure. If EET detects mod installed on BG:EE that is not listed in the above mentioned file, the installation will be aborted. It is a safety measure to avoid problems during EET installation that could result in installation errors. It also eliminates risk that the BG2 portion of the game will be affected by BG:EE mods. If your BG:EE mod is not listed in the 'compatibility.list ' file you can either request me checking it out or use this tool yourself and find out if there are any possible conflicts. Here is how you can use this tool:
1. Move 'BGEE_to_EET_mod_checker' directory and 'setup-BGEE_to_EET_mod_checker.exe' file into your BG:EE folder.
2. You need to be sure that the 'override' folder within the BG:EE directory contains only files added/modified by mod that you want to check with this tool. In order to do so delete or move all files that are currently in 'override' folder, than when the folder is empty install your mod (If your mod biffs any files during installation you need to change the code to move all files to 'override' folder instead of biffing them).
3. Double click the 'setup-BGEE_to_EET_mod_checker.exe' file and wait for the message that the mod has been successfully installed. It doesn't change anything during installation, but checks each file located in the override directory and compare them with a list of resources that may conflict with EET.
4. Open up the 'BGEE_to_EET_mod_checker/list.txt' file. If it is empty your mod should be already compatible with EET installation without any additional compatibility patches. There are following messages that can be present within the file:
- Incompatibility BG1: filename
- Incompatibility BG2: filename
- ANIMATE.IDS / EXTANIM.2DA / EXTSPEED.2DA file detected

The first type of warning is for files that are part of vanilla BG:EE game, but are also used in BG2:EE. I've decided to delete these files during EET installation, to make sure that BG2 portion of the game is not affected by the changes done by BG:EE mods unintentionally. It is also a safety measure to prevent a situation that a mod installed on BG2:EE before EET (which is not recommended) is affected. If you decide to modify these files anyway you will need to create compatibility patches for your mod (more info below).

The second type of warning means that your mod has resources that are already used by BG2:EE and are not part of vanilla BG:EE game. They should not be moved over from BG:EE during EET installation to avoid conflicts unless it is intended. Most of the time these warning are harmless because most mods just use BG2:EE files that are not present in BG:EE in unchanged state - in such case they should be deleted during EET installation via compatibility patches. If your mod adds these files in a modified form or your filenames simply conflict with BG2:EE resources but are used for different purpose, than you need to create compatibility patches for your mod (more info below). Keep in mind that you should delete them anyway and modify copies already existing in BG2:EE via COPY_EXISTING command.

The last one is related to a new common animation standard for BG:EE games introduced by Viader's Extended Animations that has been merged into EET. If your mod adds new animations files you should check if they follow this common standard - if yes than you can ignore this warning. If no than you should adopt your mod to be compatible with it.

Creating compatibility patches for conflicting mod:
Instead of writing a long and confusing tutorial I recommend you checking out existing patches for BG:EE mods located in 'EET/compat/' directory. For example let's take a look at Drizzt Saga:
- The folder they are located is named 'drizztsaga'. The name of this folder is not free to choose - it should be named exactly the same as the mod, so the EET can automatically detect the presence of this mod within BG:EE weidu.log file;
- Inside you can find 'list.txt' file - this is the file generated with this tool, that have been used to locate all the resource conflicts. As you can see there are additional comments added that explains each of the report and inform where the problem lays and if it can be ignored or need patching. It is not used anywhere, but it's always good to provide proper documentation - please add it also for your mod. As you can see the only problems detected are related to new animations added by Drizzt Saga into BG:EE;
- 'mcor.*' files are direct copy of BG2:EE resources - so the warnings are harmless and the files should be deleted - mod will use BG2:EE version already present in game;
- 'mtan.*' files are almost the direct copy of BG:EE vanilla MARILITH animation, just recolored. Mod author should use unique slot for this creature insted of overwritting the exisiting one, so we will delete these files as well and use the vanilla MARILITH entry;
- Drizzt Saga modifies STARTARE.2DA and XPCAP.2DA in order to lift the XP CAP in BG:EE. BG2:EE doesn't have 162k XP limit, so there is no point in implementing it via Drizzt Saga. These 2 files will be deleted during EET installation and this is not a problem;
- ANIMATE.IDS has been detected. Upon closer inspection I found out that the mod does not use the common BG:EE animation standard and is overwriting existing vanilla animation entries instead. This need additional patching to resolve the issue.
All additional patching is done via 'include.tph' file located within the 'EET/compat/drizztsaga/' directory. You should use exactly the same name for this file in your mod (EET fires these patches automatically).

After creating compatibility patch for your mod send it to me and I will check it out and add it to EET installation (you can add it yourself by just adding the entry to 'EET/compatibility.list' and your patch directory to 'EET/compat/' - if the additional patch is even necessary). If you have a problem with creating it send me the link to your mod and I will help you out or even create it myself. This tutorial may sound confusing but it really is very fast and easy to make a BG:EE mod compatible with EET. Most mods don't need any compatibility patches and those that do need them often require minimum time investment (for example creating patches for such a huge mod as BG1NPC Project and Drizzt Saga took me just a few minutes). The exception are tweak mods that leaves tons of junk data in override folder (for example if mod copies all cre files to override there will be tons of warnings). Tweak mods are usually compatible with both BG:EE and BG2:EE so there is no point in installing them on BG:EE before installing EET on BG2:EE.
