<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET) is a modification for Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition that merges whole saga into one game and provides continuity between the events of Baldur's Gate, Tales of the Sword Coast, Shadows of Amn, Throne of Bhaal and upcoming <a href="http://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/40963/the-adventure-y-swords-not-words-only-facts">Adventure Y</a> (also both Black Pits adventures). The name of this this modification probably rings a bell to those who have been following IE modding scene, thanks to the classic mod that inspired this project, called Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT), developed by Bardez and Ascension64. While EET remains mostly faithful to the premise of the BGT, it shouldn't be considered a direct continuation of that project. In fact both mods shares little to no common code and took different design decisions in many aspects (more information in <a href="#faq">F.A.Q</a>).</p>

<p>Main features:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Playing all Infinity Engine Baldur's Gate saga games in Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition engine. One game, complete package.</li>
	<li>Continuity between the events of CHARNAME from the beginning up until the end of his/her story in Throne of Bhaal. Seamless experience.</li>
	<li>BG1->BG2 and BG2->ToB transition between games for NPCs.</li>
	<li>Getting rid of restrictions in travelling between BG1, BG2 and ToB areas.</li>
	<li>Solution for mods that are designed to affect BG1 and BG2 content at the same time.</li>
	<li>Mod friendly platform to create new modifications.</li>
</ul>

<div class="content">
<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>EET requires the following:</p>

<div class="important" pbzloc="321">
<p pbzloc="323">The BG2:EE installation (patch v1.3 is required) must be a "clean" installation; no modifications whatsoever should be installed on it.</p>
</div>

<div class="important" pbzloc="315">
<p pbzloc="324">The BG:EE installation (patch v1.3.2053 is required) should be either "clean" installation or with any combination of mods listed in the <a href="#faq">F.A.Q</a> section.</p>
</div>

<div class="important" pbzloc="318">
<p>At least 3.0 GB of free disk space for the installation process (after installation is complete the size is optimized). For virtual memory purposes, at least 4.0 GB of free disk space is recommended during installation. Once the installation is complete EET modification occupies at least 1.7 GB of disk space (depending on the amount of mods installed on BG:EE, before EET is installed on BG2:EE).</p>
</div>

<div class="important" pbzloc="315">
<p pbzloc="324"><a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/category/63-worldmap/">BP-BGT Worldmap</a> is fully supported. Even though EET can work without it, some mods may require this special map (should be mentioned in the mod's readme, if this is the case). If you're going to install it, do so at the end, after any BP-BGT Worldmap compatible mods that add new areas.</p>

<h2>Installation and Uninstallation</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<div class="important">
<p>It is recommended that you disable virus scanners, spyware scanners, and other background on-the-fly file scanners during the installation. These programs have been known in some cases to interfere with the WeiDU installation process.</p>
</div>

<div class="important">
<p>The installation checks that the Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition installation directory you typed contains a full game. If the installation needs to be aborted to correct your BG:EE installation, you can safely close the installation window or press Ctrl+C.</p>
</div>

<div class="important">
<p>You may uninstall Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition if desired. If you think you may want to-reinstall EET at a later date, leave BG:EE installed.</p>
</div>

<p>You can either use <a href="">Big World Setup</a> to download, extract and install EET and other mods or install the mod manually:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Extract EET-v#.7z to your <strong>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition</strong> install directory</li>
	<li>Run Setup-EET.exe in your Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition install directory and follow the installation prompts</li>
</ol>
<hr />

<h3>Uninstallation and Reinstallation</h3>

<p>Run Setup-EET.exe in your Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition install directory and follow the installation prompts</p>
<hr />

<h3>Auto-installation (for expert users)</h3>

<p>Follow the first 2 steps mentioned above. Instead of directly running the executable go to the command line, navigate to your installation directory, and execute Setup-EET.exe using the construction below. Alternatively, place the construction in a batch file or the Run... dialog in the Start menu.</p>

<div class="important">
<p>Setup-EET.exe --force-install 0 --skip-at-view --language <em>X</em> --args-list <em>[flags]</em> <em>[path]</em></p>
</div>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<div class="important">
<table border="1">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><em>X</em></td>
			<td>
			<p>0 - English<br />
			1 - Polish</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>[flags]</em></td>
			<td>
			<p>Any combination of below flags should be typed as one string (no whitespaces)</p>
			
			<p>0 or 1 - suppress prompt for choosing the WeiDU TLK language directory if different language than selected for EET installation is specified within weidu.conf file located in BG:EE directory. 0 - leave the weidu.conf as it is, 1 - update weidu.conf to use the same language as EET installation.</p>

			<p>m or M - suppress failed installation message that normally shows up if BG:EE installation contains mods not listed on EET BG:EE mods compatibility list (not recommended unless you really know what you are doing).</p>

			<p>d or D - keep EET installation files (at least 1GB) after the installation is complete (for debug purposes only, they are not necessary to uninstall/reinstall the mod)</p>
			
			<p>p or P - pre-define the full path to the Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition directory; if the path is invalid, setup will prompt for a valid path</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>[path]</em></td>
			<td>the full path, in quotes, to your Baldur's Gate:Enhanced Edition installation directory, used in conjunction with p or P in <em>[flags]</em></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="important">
<p>Setup-EET.exe --force-install 0 --skip-at-view --language 0 --args-list 1p "C:\Program Files (x86)\BeamDog\Games\00766"</p>
</div>

<p>This construction installs EET with the English language, automatically updates weidu.conf file located in BG:EE directory to use the same language as the one chosen for EET installation (if such unusual situation occurs), and pre-defines the Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition directory as C:\Program Files (x86)\BeamDog\Games\00766.</p>

<p><strong>How to start the game?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Baldur's Gate</strong> - first icon in main menu (choosing this option allows you to play whole saga from start to finish - BG1, TotSC, BG2:SoA, BG2: ToB)</li>
	<li><strong>Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal</strong> - second icon in main menu</li>
	<li><strong>Black Pits II: Gladiators of Thay</strong> - third icon in main menu</li>
	<li><strong>Black Pits</strong> - start Black Pits II and choose new dialogue response during the first conversation in tavern: "You can tell a ballad with more subtleties and nuances if you have experienced something first hand. Listen to my story." (after finishing Black Pits portion you will again end up in Black Pits 2 tavern, so you can continue this adventure with the same party.)</li>
	<li><strong>Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn</strong> - start Baldur's Gate, equip a book (darker one) that has been added to your inventory and use it in game (your character will receive missing XP if it's below 95k and Bhaal powers. Mages will automatically receive memorized spells appropriate to BG2 starting level, in the same way as if you would choose "pick for me" during character generation)</li>
	<li><strong>Tutorial</strong> - start Baldur's Gate, equip a book (brighter one) that has been added to your inventory and use it in game</li>
</ul>

<div class="important" pbzloc="315">
<p pbzloc="324">I'd like to change how the above works to get rid of Black Pits from the main menu and use the slot for Baldur's Gate 2 instead. Unfortunately worldmap GUI button is disabled when the BP game is started and as far as I know it can be changed only via exe patching. If someone is interested in helping out with this task than please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/user/6375-k4thos/">contact me</a>.</p>

<a id="FAQ2" name="FAQ2"></a>

<p><strong>What are the differences between this modification and the original Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition?</strong></p>

<p>Nothing significant, at least in the way you're going to experience it. Technically there are some minor adjustments to make the BG1 portion of the game compatible with BG2 resources but it's not something that you will notice in game. The only gameplay difference that I can think of is the way the Iron Crisis items shattering is handled. Unlike vanilla game, in EET Iron Crisis affects not only normal steel weapons (0.5% chance for each attack in EET, compared to 1% in BG1) but armours (0.2% on hit), shields (0.2%) and helmets (0.1%) too. The effect is true for your party and enemies. I consider it more a restoration rather than tweak, as from game files it's pretty clear that at least armours and shields were meant to break since they have corresponding flags set and unused icons are present too. If you don't like this feature then install EET Tweaks components that will allow you to make it work exactly as in the vanilla game. Other than this obviously the game won't finish after the BG1 end credits. Whole game is also using new Worldmap.</p>

<p><strong>What are the differences between this modification and the original Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition?</strong></p>

<p>For the most part everything remains the same. There are however few new features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Full transition between BG1 and BG2 portion of the game for join-able NPCs present in both games regardless if you have them in party during transition (in vanilla game only CHARNAME could be moved to BG2 via character or save import functionality).</li>
	<li>Full transition between BG2 and ToB portion of the game for join-able NPCs (in vanilla game only those in your party were moved to ToB - other characters were spawned with new CRE files loosing all adjustments you've made to them at some point).</li>
	<li>A way to go back to BG1 areas in BG2: Shadows of Amn chapter 7 or later.</li>
	<li>A way to go back to BG1 and BG2 areas even after finishing SoA and starting Throne of Bhaal expansion (after leaving Saradush).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What are the differences between BGT and EET?</strong></p>

<p>Technically EET is not a port of BGT for Enhanced Edition engine. Without going too much into details I listed some of the changes that will be visible for end user that is familiar with BGT. I've skipped things that are unique to Enhanced Edition content, as it's kinda obvious that you won't find in BGT anything that has been created by Beamdog, such as Black Pits I and II campaigns, new NPCs and areas. BGT descriptions in the below table have been written mostly using Ascension64 quotes from the old topic, with the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/18860-bgttutu-merger-discussion/">BGT/TuTu merger discussion</a>.</p>

		<td class="tg">Resource naming and conventions</td>
		<td class="tg">BGT has a radical system of renaming the BG1 areas. The area prefix is still "AR", but the numbers have no bearing on the original BG1 area numbers. This is because BG1 area numbers conflict with those in BG2, and maintaining 'compatibility', the numbers need to changed. As an example, Candlekeep is AR2600 in BG1 but AR0015 in BGT. For another, AR4400 in BG1 is AR3300 in BGT. Area .BCS, .BMP, .MOS, .TIS, and .WED files follow the same naming convention as the .ARE files.<br>
		<br>
		For other resources, BGT keeps the original BG1 resource name as strictly as possible. However, the progressive nature of BGT takes into account incompatibilities with modifications founded and completed before the BGT-WeiDU revolution. For example, the modification 'Never,Ending Journey' uses IMOEN6.CRE, and so BGT compensates in this specific, case by renaming IMOEN6.CRE to IMOEN61.CRE. This is an unusual case, and only a few others are present. Typically, BGT will prefix with "BG". For example, other 'Never Ending Journey' incompatibility, is WOLF.CRE, which BGT renames to BGWOLF.CRE. Due to 2 characters prefix there are instances where filenames had to be changed to fit in 8 characters limit (no common convention, usually by dropping 1 or 2 letters)<br>
		<br>
		BGT makes some technical changes to how the BG1 portion of the game operates within BG2:<br>
		1. NPCs joinable in BG1 that also exists in BG2 (Edwin, Imoen, Jaheira, Minsc, Viconia) shares the same JOIN, POST and BANTER dialogue files. BGT appends BG1 dialogues at the end of BG2 files with additional variables to prevent incorrect text to show up (also forces mods to do the same).<br>
		2. BG1 chapters has different numbers than in vanilla BG1 (Prologue is considered as Chapter 1 instead of 0, so chapter globals are incremented by one relative to the actual chapter number)<br>
		3. BGT for some reason changes all BG1 entrances and most door names instead of living them as they were in BG1, which results in area incompatibility between platforms<br>
		4. to make BGT compatible with mega-mods Ascension64 decided to make some controversial changes (for example changed Dynaheir <em>Death Variable</em>)
		</td>
		<td class="tg">EET has a straightforward system of renaming the BG1 areas. The numbers are untouched, but the prefix "AR" is changed to "BG". This maintains the consistency and validity of BG1 area references from a number of public documents, including walkthroughs, travel maps, and the like. Therefore, these documents can be referred to for an area number guide to EET, except that the prefix change from "AR" to "BG" must be considered when, for example, using the CLUAConsole, or when developing BG1 modifications. Area related files, all use the same naming guidelines as the .ARE files.<br>
		<br>
		Like BGT, EET keeps the original BG1 non area resource name as strictly as possible. There is no point in changing the name if both BG:EE and BG2:EE share the same resources. For conflicting resources BG1 ones have suffix with the underscore (_) to make them unique. Since the engine only supports 8.3 filenames, 8-character resources from BG1 have their last character replaced by the underscore character (only 2 files: endcrdit.wbm => endcrdi_.wbm, blackpit.wbm => blackpi_.wbm), or have "0" character removed if replacing the last character would result in overlapping resource names (skelwa02.cre => skelwa2_.cre, skelwa03.cre => skelwa3_.cre, also used for random item tables that looks the same as in vanilla BG:EE but with dropped 0).<br>
		<br>
		On technical level EET aims to stay as close as possible to BG:EE:<br>
		1. BG:EE JOIN (file that has all NPC normal dialogues) and POST (conversation when NPC is leaving the party) dialogue files for joinable NPCs uses standard EET renaming convention (underscore suffix) to prevent conflicts with BG2 files. This approach allows modders to write/edit NPC dialogues without worrying about conflicts between games and eliminates a problem with finding correct dialogue block numbers within the file. Only BANTER dialogues are appended (engine limitation).<br>
		2. EET uses the same chapter numbers as BG1/BG:EE<br>
		3. Entrances and Door names unchanged<br>
		4. EET makes changes to BG:EE files only to prevent conflicts with BG2:EE, not to force them on modders just because some megamod author didn't bother to use community standard prefixes...

		<td class="tg">BG1->SoA transition</td>
		<td class="tg">The BGT transition is a compulsory core component, and the nature of it can be considered the minimal-extended type. After killing Sarevok, the final movie displays but the credits do not show and force the player back to the main menu. Instead, the game continues and a string is displayed suggesting the player should go to the Duchal Palace. There, they will meet Belt. Interestingly, if Belt was killed during Sarevok's foible coronation, Belt still appears for the transition. Belt conjures up a cover story about continuing tensions between Baldur's Gate and Amn and asks the player to deliver a message to the Council of Six. The details are sketchy, but Belt teleports the players to an undisclosed location near Amn. There, a cutscene is only shown, where Shadow Thieves led by Mae'Var ambush the players and take them to Irenicus' dungeon. This cutscene also serves as the vehicle through which many journal entries are removed, items are checked for importation, and NPC transitions are made, if applicable. When in Irenicus' dungeon, the Shadows of Amn introduction movie is played, then Shadows of Amn proper commences.<br></td>
		<td class="tg">There's nothing that I could write here from the story standpoint. For now EET transition to BG2 starts right after the final BG1 battle. In future, this part of the game will be expanded to fully merge in upcoming <a href="http://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/40963/the-adventure-y-swords-not-words-only-facts">Adventure Y</a>, official expansion made by Beamdog and approved by Wizards of the Coas, so hopefully a quality content that will expand upon "leaving Baldur's Gate under circumstances much darker than anyone would have believed" quote from BG2 intro. As for the technical differences, EET transition script is not limited to the party members like in BGT. For example if you had Jaheira and Khalid any time during your game, and then dumped them some way down the road, Jaheira will still transition to BG2 portion of the game (missing XP from the BG2 version counterpart will be added, so you don't need to worry about it). If NPC dies then you won't find him/her in BG2 (except Imoen and Edwin - these 2 are required due to the plot).</td>

		<td class="tg">BG2->ToB transition<br></td>
		<td class="tg">Not existing in BGT, uses vanilla system, which means NPCs summoned by Spirit in AR4500 will be newly created creatures (they will lose their original items, level, stats etc. even if you had them in BG2, but not in final BG2 confrontation).<br></td>
		<td class="tg">EET provides full transition for all vanilla NPCs that you had in party at some point. If you didn't hire NPC at any time during BG2 portion of the game you won't be able to even summon them (you don't know them, so they are not on the summon list). Same goes for dead former party members. BG1 NPCs that weren't present in BG2 will be mentioned, even if not summonable.</td>

	  <tr>
		<td class="tg">Conversion method<br></td>
		<td class="tg">BGT comes with all BG1 .ARE, .BCS, .DLG and many .CRE files. Files extracted directly from the BG1 installation directory are mostly graphic and sound/music resources. This approach was necessary due to amount of bugs present in the original BG1 that BGT aimes to fix. Resources that are not used in game, or being present in BG2 are not extracted.<br>
		<br>
		Thanks to this approach the installation is fast and fluid. According to BGT readme file installation time will depend on the abilities of your system, but as a rough estimate installation may take anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hour. In my experience these estimates are rather pessimistic. You can expect the installation on mid range laptop to take closer to 10-15 minutes.<br></td>
		<td class="tg">EET took entirely different conversion method than BGT. Instead of coming with pre-made files, all resources are converted "on the fly", thanks to the great macros created by A64 in his <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=8119">Platform Conversion Utility (PCU)</a>, that have been expanded by me to cover whole game. This approach allows EET to be compatible with changing EE games content (massive differences in each patch released by Beamdog) with little to no changes in EET code. Every resource or reference to resource that need to be renamed, are identified during installation and updated if necessary. Additional benefit of this type of conversion is compatibility with many BG:EE mods (installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE) without need for modders to adopt code to another platform.<br>
		<br>
		The downside of this approach is longer installation time compared to BGT. On mid range laptop (without SSD) it can take 30-40 minutes, and with dialogue heavy mods installed on BG:EE the installation may be even longer.<br></td>

		6. Built in support for BG:EE mods. Support for mega-mods will be added if needed once such mods become available for BG2:EE (although not via renaming conflicting vanilla BG:EE files as BGT does.

<p><strong>What BG:EE mods are compatible with EET?</strong></p>

<p>As a result of the conversion method explained above, EET provides limited support for mods installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE. Theoretically it could support almost any BG:EE mod with little to no work needed (for example adjusting BG1NPC Project to work with this method required just a few lines of code. Many mods don't need anything changed at all). To ensure that BG:EE mods not intervene with BG2:EE portion of the game EET will prevent starting the installation when unrecognised mods are detected. More information about this matter can be found in BGEE_to_EET_mod_checker tool <a href="../other/mod checker/BGEE_to_EET_mod_checker/readme.txt">readme</a> that is used to find possible conflicts with BG2 resources and content. For now following BG:EE mods are supported when installed on BG:EE previous to installing EET on BG2:EE (they will be removed from the list if/when they receive native EET support):</p>

	<p>Above list also shows install order suggested by <a href="">Big World Project</a>. Compatibility with EET doesn't mean that mods are fully compatible with each other - refer to original readme files and forum discussions for compatibility details. Although when it comes to above mentioned files, according to BWP/BWS there aren't any known problems to run them all together. Mods have been tested with versions mentioned in above list. It's unlikely that newer ones will break something, as the changes are minimal if made at all. Although let me know if it happens.</p>
</ul>

<a id="FAQ6" name="FAQ6"></a>

<p><strong>What BG2:EE mods are compatible with EET?</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to mods that alters only BG2 and ToB content than from technical perspective most of them should be already compatible because EET changes almost nothing in BG2 and ToB files. Even though some minor changes to mod's tp2 file may be needed due to common usage of GAME_IS WeiDU command that is used to detect what game/platform is installed. Usually all that need to be done in such cases is adding ~eet~ to the command parameters declaration. Let's hope that at some point most BG2 mods will be updated as it's really a matter of minutes.</p>

<a id="FAQ7" name="FAQ7"></a>

<p><strong>What about mods that alters both BG1 and BG2 portion of the game?</strong></p>

<p>In such case modders don't have to worry about BG2/ToB portion of the game all that much as it is practically unchanged, but should be careful when it comes to BG1 resources that in many places have been renamed to provide compatibility with BG2 ones. To make modders life a little easier EET comes with <a href="">cmpvars variable libraries</a> that can be used to prepare mods compatible with all platforms at once. The mod also provides custom version of Platform Conversion Utility (<a href="">PCU Custom</a>) that has been specialized for BG:EE and BGT mods conversions to EET. More information about developing mods with EET in mind can be found in <a href="">EET developer notes</a>.</p>

<a id="FAQ8" name="FAQ8"></a>

<p><strong>How to preserve save files after making new installation with different mods?</strong></p>

<p>Before removing current installation copy <strong>dialog.tlk</strong> (also dialogF.tlk in some languages) to appropriate <em>lang</em> subdirectory in your new installation folder. Usually this step is enough to make your saves fully functional, even if you install different mods or change installation order.</p>

<a id="FAQ9" name="FAQ9"></a>

<p><strong>What about vanilla BG2:EE saves compatibility with EET?</strong></p>

<p>BG2:EE to EET save converter will be implemented soon.</p>

<a id="FAQ10" name="FAQ10"></a>

<p><strong>Why returning back to old areas is allowed on Chapter 7 and later?</strong></p>

<p>Imagine going there right after leaving Irenicus Dungeon and taking that sweat Cloak of Balduran and other great items from where you left them in BG1... This would break the early BG2 game that is balanced around limited gold and crappy items. Going back in chapter 7 makes it more reasonable because at that point party already has access to awesome items. The second reason is modders perspective. You finish the original BG1 in chapter 7 and at that point the game is at a state where adjusting it further is easier compared to situation in which you would had take different chapters into account. Also keep in mind that you can't go back to BG1 areas if you skipped BG1 portion of the game and started playing in BG2 instead. Same is true for ToB. This option is only available for those who play whole saga from start to finish.</p>

<a id="FAQ11" name="FAQ11"></a>

<p><strong>Why would I even want to visit them again?</strong></p>

<p>Now, that's a good question... Maybe it's just me, but I've never accepted BGT as a true seamless experience because the game still felt to me like 3 completely separate ones with BG1->BG2 transition added on top of it. Even if there is nothing new to do there right now, other than finishing some missed quests, and collecting items, the feeling that you can travel everywhere may be valuable for some players. Other than this EET creates opportunities for modders to create new adventures and surprises designed for higher level parties that for example visits Baldur's Gate city in late BG2 or during ToB portion of the game. Also thanks to the enhancements made to EE engine it's now possible to create <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=27181">custom spawns</a> for high level parties without tons of code or conflicts, which may prove useful for hypothetical mods that could try to make old places interesting for returning parties. In other words it can be treated as a playground for modders to add new stuff to the game. If someone will take advantage of these new possibilities remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>Fatal Installation Errors</h3>

<p><strong>"(...) BG:EE mod is not recognized by EET, so it can't be installed on BG2:EE"</strong></p>

<p>Due to reasons specified in FAQ [add link here] EET limits "on the fly" BG:EE resources conversion to vanilla BG:EE installation and mods listed in the compatibility list. Adding other mods is fast and easy, so the list will grow over time.</p>

<p><strong>"TLK for language: (...) not found in BG:EE directory"</strong></p>

<p>Check the selected BG:EE language directory if the TLK file is indeed there</p>

<p><strong>I have Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition installed, but the installation does not accept the directory that I type in.</strong></p>

<p>The most likely scenario is that your installation is broken. Try reinstalling Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. Also you can try parsing the BG:EE directory using command line as described in installation section</p>

<p><strong>WeiDU stopped the installation because of error.</strong></p>

<p>You may not have a clean installation of Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition or some resources are corrupted</p>

<ul>
	<li>When the installation prompts for install again, quit the installation</li>
	<li>Restore dialog.tlk as described in the Installation and Uninstallation section of this file</li>
	<li>You have just reverted the installation process. Do not try to install again immediately.</li>
	<li>Try reinstalling Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and/or Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition without any modifications and than install EET.</li>
	<li>If you have other modifications installed, try uninstalling those and then install EET.</li>
	<li>If you still experience problems, post the files SETUP-EET.DEBUG and EET\bash.debug (if it exists), located in your Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition installation directory, in the <a href="">mod forum</a></li>
</ul>
 
<h3>Minor Installation Errors</h3>

<p><strong>The mod finished installing successfully, but the message is "Installed with Warnings".</strong></p>

<p>There are several additional precautions added into EET to inform the player if something went wrong. Open up SETUP-EET.DEBUG located in your Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition installation directory and search (ctrl+F) for the word "warning". If you can't figure out how to fix the problem post this debug file in the <a href="">mod forum</a>. Playing with installation that showed warning is not recommended.</p>

<p><strong>During the installation, I constantly get errors saying "There is no disk in your drive".</strong></p>

<p>This occurs if you did not follow Step 2 of the installation procedures.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you have not installed yet, or as you read this the installation is halted directly after you were asked to enter your Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition directory with the disk check, abort the installation immediately.</li>
	<li>As you read this, if the installation is halted any time after you were asked to enter your Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition directory, press 'Cancel' to every single prompt that occurs, and allow the installation to finish. When the installation is finished, uninstall EET and restore dialog.tlk.</li>
	<li>Follow the installation procedures correctly without omitting Step 2.</li>
