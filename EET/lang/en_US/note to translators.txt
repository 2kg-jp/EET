Most of EET strings are already translated elsewhere. If you are going to create a translation for EET you can use already available translations (if their authors are not against it of course) to save yourself about 90% of work.

prompts.tra - this a common file with weidu constants strings. There are many mods that come with such file, so you can just copy it over without any changes.

map_mods_trans.tra - you can find many of these strings translated in BP-BGT Worldmap. Check out string numbers added as comments. Also check out if Miloch's Sword Coast Map Labels is available in your language for even more translated strings. ### instead of spaces and area names instead of string numbers are not a mistake. This file is not directly loaded, but EET read it during installation to get these strings.

dialog.tra - as above, but in BGT.

Files located in the 'movies' directory should be converted manually to HD WBM format from BG1 MVE files. If these 4 movies had not been localized in your country than let me know - in such case I will redirect EET to copy over English ones during installation.
