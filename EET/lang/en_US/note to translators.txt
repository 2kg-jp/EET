Most of EET strings are already translated elsewhere. If you are going to create a translation for EET you can use already available translations (if their authors are not against it of course) to save yourself about 90% of work.

prompts.tra - this is a common file with weidu constants strings. There are many mods that come with such file, so you can just copy it over without any changes.

map_mods_trans.tra - you can find many of these strings translated in BP-BGT Worldmap. Check out string numbers added as comments. Also check out if Miloch's Sword Coast Map Labels mod is available in your language for even more translated strings. ### instead of spaces and area names instead of string numbers are not a mistake. This file is not directly loaded, but EET reads it during installation to get these strings.

dialog.tra - as above, but in BGT.

'movies' directory stores voices from the original BG1 movies: BEREGOST, INTRO, NASHKELL, WYVERN. You can send MVE files to WhiteAgnus, if you don't know how to export voice track only. If these 4 movies had not been localized in your country than let us know - in such case English ones will be used during installation.
