//Due to the nature of this mod it doesn't really conflict with EET, other than different naming shame for file (AR instead of FH).
//All ARE and WED data will be already modified on the fly with other resources to be compatible with BG2:EE.
//All I did in include file is renaming them to EET standard and moving new area resources to existing EET biff and patch directories
